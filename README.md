# foodieFriends

App to help foodies discover and meet new street food vendors such as in a local food festival or farmer market event, so that they can try different types of foods and help the street food vendor gain loyal customers. Allow street food vendors to announce their promotional deals to foodies. Foodies can also get the latest news from street food vendors through Twitter and facebook, such as try out their new food creation or they have finally opened up a store.
